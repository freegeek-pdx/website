BUSINESS PICKUPS
				<h4>Let us pick up your organization's outdated tech!</h4>
				<p><a href="http://www.freegeek.org/pickups/" title="Computer, laptop, printer, technology pickups"><img src="http://www.freegeek.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/img_6334-1-300x145.jpg" alt="Free Geek truck" width="200" height="97" class="alignleft" /></a>If you can't drop off your used technology, we can send you our 16' truck! There is a base charge of $120 for pickups, and we're looking to develop mutually-beneficial ongoing relationships. Because we're a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, your donations of hardware are tax-deductible--<em>and</em> we do our best to reuse as much technology as possible to support your community.</p>
				<p>If you'd like more information, or already know you'd like to request a pickup, please <a href="http://www.freegeek.org/pickups/" title="Computer, laptop, printer, technology pickups">tell us about your organization</a> and we'll follow up.</p>

PLUG INTO PORTLAND
			<h4>Free computers for Portland students who give!</h4>			
			<p>Do you know a K-12 student who attends school in Portland and would benefit from a free computer?  Help us spread the word to parents, teachers and principals that Free Geek offers free computers to Portland K-12 students who complete 24 hours of volunteer service.  Students can complete their volunteer service in any number of ways including in their communities, schools, churches or other community-oriented organizations. Unfortunately, we do not currently have enough computers available to extend this offer to students outside of Portland city limits.</p>
<p>For more information, or to request your free computer, please visit our <a href="http://www.freegeek.org/about/education/plug-into-portland/">Plug Into Portland information page</a>.
