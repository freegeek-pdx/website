Since our inception in February 2000, we have granted out over 7,500 PCs, 1,900 laptops, and many other assorted items to these organizations.</p>
				<p>We are only able to fulfill grants for organizations that can arrange to pick up granted materials at our location in Portland, OR.

						<h3>Free Geek Code of Conduct</h3>
						<p>Everyone must be treated with respect in order for Free Geek to be a safe and comfortable environment for all volunteers and staff. If you see anyone engaging in any of the below activities on Free Geek premises, please let a staff member know immediately so we can follow up appropriately. If you are not sure of the best way to find a staff member, please ask at the front desk. The following are not acceptable behaviors at Free Geek:</p>
						<ul class="square">
						<li>Acts or threats of violence, including intimidation, harassment, and/or coercion.</li>
						<li>Sexual harassment.</li>
						<li>Theft.</li>
						<li>Attitudes, judgments, jokes and language that are discriminatory or demeaning on the basis of race, class, gender, sex, age, spoken language, nationality, culture, physical appearance, sexual orientation, or ability/disability.</li>

					<h3>Adopt a computer in 24 hours</h3>
					<p>Free Geek receives donated used computers from the public and Build volunteers refurbish them with care. These computers are then “adopted out” to volunteers in exchange for 24 hours of service to our Adoption volunteers. Volunteers in the Adoption Program may disassemble computers for recycling, help sort computer equipment from donors, test basic computer components, or help keep our facility clean.</p>
					<p>Volunteer tasks in the Adoption Program can accommodate a <strong>wide range of abilities</strong> — we’ll work with you to make sure you can spend the time necessary to earn your computer. No computer experience is required to participate in this program.</p>
					</div>			
					<div class="large-6 columns">
					<h3>Learn to build your own computer</h3>
						<p>Free Geek also teaches volunteers how to refurbish and build computers. This program often takes much longer than the 24-hour Adoption Program. Those who successfully build five computers get to keep the sixth computer they build. Computers you build may go to those in the Adoption Program, local non-profits, or the thrift store.</p>
						<p>In the Build Program, you'll learn: Hardware Identification - All of the components of a computer; System Evaluation - How to test the basic functions of a computer; Build Workshop - System assembly and quality control.</p>
						<p>Do you already have skills with computers? Consider our post-build options: like laptop, Apple, and server testing and refurbishing. We have lots of options for people who want to learn more! </p>

We try hard to ensure your internship will provide you with learning and skills you can apply to paying jobs. Interns volunteer on a set schedule, learn valuable skills and play a vital role in the health of Free Geek as an organization.</p>
